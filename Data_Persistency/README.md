About our module: 
The purpose of this module is to store the data required for the Face Recognition System to work. In order to do that, several functionalities were added:
Register a client
Remove a client
Update a client
Retrieve a client’s image
Find a client (check if they’re registered in the system)
Create a YAML file that displays all registered clients 
Load all registered clients to memory
Generate a unique key (identifier) for each client
The module was developed using the programming language C++.

About the demo (main):
■ If you run “main.cpp” to test our module you’ll find that it opens your camera and stores what it saw in a cv::Mat.
■ Then it creates an object of type “Persistence” called “newClient”. 
■ newClient uses the function “registerClient” to add a new client to the database, with all its respective attributes.
■ Then we use the function “deleteClient”, that it uses the key of one of our clients to delete it from the database.
■ The function “writeToDisc” is called when you want all the information in memory written to disk.
