### General Description of the System
A system capable of fulfilling 2 particular cases (to be explained in further detail later on this document) which contemplate an automatic face recognition system was asked by the Head of Security from Tecnol칩gico de Monterrey Santa Fe Campus. The system referenced aforementioned has the intention of automating and improving the security standards in the entry points of the campus. A description of both cases is presented in the following paragraphs.<br />

Case 1: Verification of an ID card holder identity taking as a reference an image retrieved from a Databse in possession of Tecnol칩gico de Monterrey Santa Fe Campus. The system should be able to have as an output whether a confirmation or a denial (yes or no) of the identity of the person. This case is intended to be applied at the diverse entrances of the campus at issue. <br />

Case 2: Identification of any person trying to enter the campus. The developed solution should be able to capture an image from a camera located at whatever entrance point of the property; from this image, the system requires an output that indicates if a person (previously registered in a database from the institution) has been identified or not. The latest case occurs when the person being captured by the camera has not undergone a registration process by the university. As well as with Case 1, this scenario is intended to be put in practice in the coming points of the campus. <br />
