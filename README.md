### General Description of the System
A system capable of fulfilling 2 particular cases (to be explained in further detail later on this document) which contemplate an automatic face recognition system was asked by the Head of Security from Tecnol칩gico de Monterrey Santa Fe Campus. The system referenced aforementioned has the intention of automating and improving the security standards in the entry points of the campus. A description of both cases is presented in the following paragraphs. <br />

Case 1: Verification of an ID card holder identity taking as a reference an image retrieved from a Databse in possession of Tecnol칩gico de Monterrey Santa Fe Campus. The system should be able to have as an output whether a confirmation or a denial (yes or no) of the identity of the person. This case is intended to be applied at the diverse entrances of the campus at issue. <br />

Case 2: Identification of any person trying to enter the campus. The developed solution should be able to capture an image from a camera located at whatever entrance point of the property; from this image, the system requires an output that indicates if a person (previously registered in a database from the institution) has been identified or not. The latest case occurs when the person being captured by the camera has not undergone a registration process by the university. As well as with Case 1, this scenario is intended to be put in practice in the coming points of the campus. <br />

### Modules that make up the system (brief and easy to understand overview)
#### Face Detection
Via Haar Cascades, this module is in charge detecting of all faces captured by the camera in which the system is being executed. In case of having multiple matches at a certain instance (more than one), the proposed solution discards all but the one with more proximity and bigger area at that particular moment. <br />
Furthermore, a validation of the detected face described in the previous paragraph is performed. With this, the module assures that the detected object by the camera is in fact the face of a person.

#### Face Alignment
Using shape predictors in order to dectect facial landmarks (68 points thourghout any face being analyzed), this module is in charge of "normalizing" the output from the "Face Detection" module. This normalization contemplates the necessity of rotating, translating and scaling the aforementioned output so the "Features Extraction" module can perform its tasks properly.

#### Features Extraction
The Feature Extraction module takes a Mat object and extracts its information using a deep learning method that uses 29 layers in order to obtain the features, which are stored in a Mat vector size 1x128. Also, this module can make a comparison between two mat images. Both of the activities performed by this module are of great importance for the achievement of both Cases mentioned in the "General Description of the System" headland.

#### Redundancy
Last but not least, this module in in charge of storing the data requiered for the entire system to work. Functionalities like registering, removing or updating a client, retrieving a client's image, loading all the registered clients to the memory of the computers in which the system is being executed and generating unique identifiers for each client are to be done by this last module.

#### Fast Search
The Fast Search module is in charge of searching in a data set if there are any coincidences of one person. This is possible thanks to the FLANN library which is in charge of creating an index based on the features that are in the database. This, allows the comparison between one person and the database using a KNN Neighbor search, making possible for the system to find the 10 closest Feature vectors and return it.
