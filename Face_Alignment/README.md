# TC2004.1 Team 2: Detection of landmarks and face alignment.
The purpose of this module is to adjust received images with a face detected, using predefined parameters to have the resulting images in the same format. The program makes the adjustments from a recevied position where a face had been detected, the landmarks are drawn in order to use strategic points to correctly scale, rotate and tranform the image, resulting in an aligned and cropped face of the person in the image.

It is important to have the following model “shape_predictor_5_face_landmarks.dat” downloaded (it is already included in the src folder) as it is our face landmarking model to align faces to a standard pose.

Apart from the OpenCV library, you will also need to download the most recent version of the Dlib library on your computer, which you can download from the following link: http://dlib.net/ 

By doing this, on your CMakeLists.txt, you must modify line 9 with the path in which your “cmake" (from the dlib folder) is, for example: 
include (C:/Users/malte/Downloads/dlib-19.21/dlib/cmake). On the same note, line 17 should also be modified with the path in which you have installed your OpenCV and the subdirectory "build”. 

With this, there should be no problem in compiling the module’s code. 

Following so, the steps to compile and run the module are the following:
1. mkdir build (if the file doesn’t exist)
2. cd build
3. cmake ..
4. cmake — build . —config Release
5. ./my_project
